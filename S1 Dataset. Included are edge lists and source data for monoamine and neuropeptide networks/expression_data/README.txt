NOTES
-----

These are TSV (tab-separated value) files.

The first row is a header describing each column. The number in the 'reference' column refers to the supplementary references (included here in TSV format).

Some receptors (both monoamine and neuropeptide) have been excluded from the analyses in the main body of this study - these are marked with a '1' in the 'excluded' column. See the 'excluded_reason' column for notes. 

Individual neurons are listed, rather than pairs/classes.

Neurons whose name includes a number are not zero-padded, for compatibility with community resources like OpenWorm and WormBase.
